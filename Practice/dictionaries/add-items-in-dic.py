Let's practice updating values from dicitionaries.

We use the same [] approach that we used when updating values. 

If a key we try to update doesn't exist, it adds it to the dictionary.

# Welcome Back to StockY
# There are many new released sneakers we need to add to our inventory. 

inventory = {'Jordan 1' : 1,
             'Yeezy'    : 8,
             'Air Max'  : 10,
             'SB Dunk'  : 5,
             'Cortez'   : 20,
             'Jordan 6' : 100 }

# TODO: 
# 1. Go to https://www.kicksonfire.com/app/
# 2. Pick 3 sneakers we should sell at our shop
# 3. Add 10 pairs of each to our inventory dictionary.

inventory["DUnk High Michigan 2020"] = 10
inventory["Puma Blaze"] = 10
inventory["Jordan 10"] = 10
