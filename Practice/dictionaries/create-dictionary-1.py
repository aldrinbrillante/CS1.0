Let's practice creating a dictionary!

Dicitonaries are a collection of key:value pairs.

# You own an empanada shop and want to store the price of each type (flavor) of empanadas. 

# TODO: Convert the two lists below into a dictionary called menu, where the key is the flavor and the value is the price (as an int)

flavors = ["chicken", "beef", "cheese", "guava"]
prices = [1.99, 1.99, 1.00, 2.50]

#create the dictionary below
menu = {"chicken":1.99, "beef":1.99, "cheese":1.00, "guava":2.50}
